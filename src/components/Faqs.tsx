                        <p className="text-lg text-[#33405E]">Landbot&apos;s onboarding team helps you in the application process. Once you sign up for Landbot&apos;s WhatsApp solution, our team will ask you to submit the required information and initiate the application process on your behalf. The entire process usually lasts around 1-2 weeks, regardless of which provider you work with. We take utmost care to ensure each business we collaborate with has their application approved, managing the application process at every step of the way. However, ultimately, the final approval decision rests with WhatsApp.</p>
